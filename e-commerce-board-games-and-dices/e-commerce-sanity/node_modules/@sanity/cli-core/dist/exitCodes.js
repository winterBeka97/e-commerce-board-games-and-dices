 * Standard exit codes for CLI commands.

 * - 0, 1, 2 align with oclif defaults and Unix convention.
 * - 3 is application-defined (oclif does not use it).
 * - 130 follows the Unix convention of 128 + signal number (SIGINT = 2).
 *
 * @see CLAUDE.md "Exit Code Convention" for usage guidance and examples.
